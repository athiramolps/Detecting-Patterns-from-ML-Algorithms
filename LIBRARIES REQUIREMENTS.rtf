\f0\fs24 \cf0 Your `requirements.txt` file should list all the Python libraries and their versions required for your project. Based on your description, it seems like you'll need scikit-learn for implementing the various regression algorithms. Here's how you can structure your `requirements.txt`:\
\
```\
scikit-learn==<version>\
```\
\
Replace `<version>` with the specific version of scikit-learn you want to use. You can find the latest version by checking the scikit-learn documentation or using pip to install the latest version and then checking the installed version using `pip show scikit-learn`.\
\
So your `requirements.txt` file will look something like this:\
\
```\
scikit-learn==<version>\
```\
\
You can include other libraries if you're using them in your project as well. If you're using Jupyter notebooks for your analysis, you might want to include `jupyter` in your `requirements.txt` as well:\
\
```\
scikit-learn==<version>\
jupyter==<version>\
```\
\
Again, replace `<version>` with the specific version you want to use. Once you have your `requirements.txt` file set up, you can install all the dependencies listed in it by running:\
\
```\
pip install -r requirements.txt\
```\
\
This command will install all the required libraries along with their specified versions, ensuring that your project's environment is reproducible.}
